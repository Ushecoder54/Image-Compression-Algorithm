Image-Compression: Image compression algorithm using the Pillow library in Python to compress an image using the JPEG compression format

Introduction
What is image compression?
Image compression is a process applied to a graphics file to minimize its size in bytes without degrading image quality below an acceptable threshold. By reducing the file size, more images can be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space. The image also requires less bandwidth when being transmitted over the internet or downloaded from a webpage, reducing network congestion and speeding up content delivery.

Installation;
1-Choose a programming language: The JPEG compression algorithm can be implemented in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, etc. Choose the language you are comfortable with.

2-Install the necessary libraries: Depending on the programming language you choose, you may need to install certain libraries to implement the JPEG compression algorithm. For example, if you choose Python, you can use the Pillow library, which can be installed using pip. If you choose Java, you can use the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library.

3-Implement the algorithm: Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can implement the JPEG compression algorithm.

4-Test the algorithm: After implementing the algorithm, you should test it to ensure that it is working correctly. You can use various test images and compare the file sizes before and after compression to check the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Usage;
1.Install the necessary software: Depending on the algorithm you choose, you may need to install specific software or libraries to use it. For example, if you are using the JPEG algorithm, you may need to install a library like Pillow or OpenCV.

2.Select an image: Choose an image that you want to compress. It is best to choose a high-resolution image with a large file size to see the impact of compression.

3.Set compression parameters: Most compression algorithms have various parameters that you can adjust to control the level of compression. For example, the JPEG algorithm has a quality parameter that determines the level of compression applied to the image. Higher quality means less compression and a larger file size, while lower quality means more compression and a smaller file size. Adjust these parameters based on your needs.

4.Compress the image: Use the chosen algorithm and software to compress the image. The process may vary depending on the software and algorithm used, but typically you need to open the image file and apply the compression algorithm with the chosen parameters.

5.Check the compressed image: After compressing the image, check the file size and quality of the compressed image. If the quality is acceptable and the file size is significantly smaller, you can use the compressed image
